My browser tabs are mostly interesting articles and running race information that I need to get back to, but in reality I never get the time to finish them.

We are lost in all the links, tiktoks and YouTube videos. It is not entirely our fault. The algorithms of modern systems including YouTube are trying to keep us within their system.
